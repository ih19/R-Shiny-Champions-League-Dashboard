# R-Shiny-Champions-League-Dashboard
This project is a Shiny dashboard that visualizes the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League data for European clubs. The dashboard includes team standings, player statistics, club locations, and interactive charts such as radar plots and maps. It combines scraped data, backup datasets, and manual statistics for a complete overview of the competition.

├─ data_scraper.R          # Scrapes UCL standings and player stats, saves backup .RData

Prerequisites

Make sure you have R (>= 4.0) installed and the following R packages:

install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "plotly", "dplyr", "tidyr", "lubridate", "rvest", "jsonlite"
))

Running the Project:

Set your working directory to the project folder:

setwd("path/to/ChampionsLeague_Project")


Run the data scraper to collect/update the data:

source("data_scraper.R")


This will fetch standings and player stats from FBref.

If scraping fails, it uses a backup dataset (champions_league_data.RData).

The data will be saved locally for the dashboard.

Launch the Shiny dashboard:

library(shiny)
runApp("2_ucl_dashboard.R")


This opens the dashboard in a browser or RStudio Viewer.

Explore interactive charts for teams, players, and country statistics.

Optional: Combined Run

You can automate both steps by sourcing a single script that runs the scraper first, then launches the dashboard:

# combined_run.R
source("data_scraper.R")   # Collect or load data
library(shiny)
runApp("2_ucl_dashboard.R") # Launch dashboard


Then just run:

source("combined_run.R")

Features

Team Overview: Standings, wins, draws, losses, points, goal difference.

Top Scorers: Goals, assists, xG/xA stats.

Geospatial Analysis: Clubs displayed on a Europe map by city and country.

Interactive Charts: Radar charts, scatter plots, and more via Plotly.

Notes

Web scraping may fail if FBref updates their website; the backup .RData ensures the app still works.

Ensure all required packages are installed.

Dashboard relies on the champions_league_data.RData file generated by the scraper.
